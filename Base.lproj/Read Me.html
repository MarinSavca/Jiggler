<big><big>C</big></big>ongratulations on your fine taste and discerning judgment in downloading this most excellent Stick Software product.  This file is included inside Jiggler itself, so you do not need to keep it.  It can be accessed from Jiggler's help menu.<br><br><br>

<b>Jiggler</b> is a little application that jiggles your mouse cursor periodically.  It can keep your screensaver from kicking in, keep your CPU from falling asleep, or otherwise keep your Mac on its toes.<br><br>

To <B>install</B> Jiggler, simply copy it to your local hard drive.  It does not need to be installed anywhere in particular; you can put it wherever you like.  However, /Applications and ~/Applications are standard folders for applications in Mac OS X which may be used (where the '~' symbol represents the current user's home directory).  Typically, /Applications contains applications that are installed system-wide for all users of the machine, while ~/Applications contains applications private to the current user.  Drag Jiggler from the disk image it is distributed on, into the folder where you wish to install it.  After it has been copied, you may 'eject' and throw away the distribution disk image.  It is recommended that you do not run Jiggler directly off of the disk image.  If you are unfamiliar with the use of disk images (.dmg files), you can <A HREF="http://www.sticksoftware.com/support/diskimages.html" target="_blank">read more about disk images</A> on Stick Software's web site.<br><br>

Jiggler is now (as of version 1.7) a <B>status bar item</B> rather than a regular application.  This means that it appears as an icon in your menu bar, rather than in the Dock.  Jiggler has no menu bar of its own, so all of its commands are accessed through a menu that drops down when its icon in the menu bar is clicked.  To quit Jiggler, for example, click on the Jiggler icon in the menu bar, and select the Quit Jiggler menu item from the menu that pops down.<br><br>

It is usually desirable for Jiggler to <b>launch automatically</b> whenever you log in.  To achieve this, you can check the "Launch Jiggler automatically on login" checkbox in Jiggler's preferences, which are accessible through Jiggler's Preferences menu item.  You can then turn Jiggler on and off as desired using the Jiggler Enabled menu item in its menu, without needing to quit and relaunch Jiggler.<br><br>

To <B>uninstall</B> Jiggler, simply drag Jiggler from your hard drive to the trash.<br><br>
