Jiggler is a little freeware app with one purpose: to keep your Mac awake. When you have some lengthy task for your computer to do, it's annoying to have to turn off your screensaver and turn off the sleep timer, only to have to turn it all back on again when you're done. (The "never sleep" corner will keep your screensaver from kicking in, but still won't prevent your machine from falling asleep.) What you really want is a little helper who will bump your mouse every once in a while to keep your machine alert. That's Jiggler.

Jiggler is a [Stick Software](http://www.sticksoftware.com) product.  If you like it, please check out some of our shareware products at [www.sticksoftware.com](http://www.sticksoftware.com) â€“ and pay for them if you use them!

Development & Feedback
-----------------------------------
Jiggler is not under active development, but we would welcome pull requests with useful features.  If you want us to take your pull request, please don't add features that only you are likely to want (no kitchen sink!), and please try to keep the user interface simple and comprehensible.  Jiggler is already quite complicated for such a simple concept!

Jiggler's code is, well, not great.  Although Jiggler's code was open-sourced in 2016, much of its code was written as much as 15 years ago.  In addition, much of its code is chunks ripped out of other projects that have not been open-sourced, so there are doubtless vestigial relationships and pointless excursions.  If I were writing it today, I would do many things differently.  Be gentle.
