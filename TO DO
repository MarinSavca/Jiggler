Suggestions:

add warning if jiggle time is >= sleep time or screensaver time?
	screensaver time: defaults -currentHost write com.apple.screensaver idleTime 180
	sleep time: not sure how to get this

detect network activity and stay awake on it (looks complicated in practice, because of multiple network interfaces, etc.; see source at http://www.ragingmenace.com/software/menumeters/)

Add to Timed Quit the option to quit at a specified date/time, rather than after a specified number of minutes

add an option such that the screensaver runs while Jiggler is active; i.e. keep the machine from sleeping, but run the screensaver.
	similarly, it would be good to have a setting whereby Jiggler allows the display to sleep, but prevents the system from sleeping
	this would entail shifting from IOPMAssertionDeclareUserActivity() to creating an assertion with kIOPMAssertPreventUserIdleSystemSleep
	but without kIOPMAssertPreventUserIdleDisplaySleep, using IOPMAssertionCreateWithDescription().  The drawback to this is that we
	have to declare when the assertion is over, too, rather than just tweaking the system periodically.  Should be doable, though.

when a chosen app (set in jigger preferences) is in the foreground .. . jigger does its thing .. but when this app is in the background .. the computer can goto sleep, screen-saver etc... but this kind of option would have to be an add-on not one-or-the-other kind of thing. because you hate to lose  the "if any chosen app is open"  thing... another example would be like when quicktime plays a video the computer does nothing but play, but when its not playing or if the video ends,  then the mac goes nighty night   etc.
